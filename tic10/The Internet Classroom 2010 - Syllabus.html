              <p class="noMargin">Assignments/Quests</p>
            </div>
            <p>Assignments, or quests as we will call them, do not have any set due dates. This means you will be permitted to proceed at your own pace, depending on what material you find to be difficult, but also means you will need to invoke some self-discipline in order to not fall too far behind! Quests are also not graded in the traditional sense; we will not be giving a grade or point value for each assignment. </p>
            <p>Instead, your assignment must meet a set of stated goals and it is either done or not done. Every quest will give you a certain amount of XP, or experience points. These will go towards your level, which designates your total &quot;completion&quot; of the course material. You must be of a certain level in order to progress onto more difficult material, in addition to taking the appropriate gating &quot;quiz&quot;. </p>
            <p>Some quests will also give you credits, a currency with which you can purchase items from the store. We will reveal more about this in upcoming weeks.</p>
            <div class="h3">
              <p class="noMargin">Quizzes</p>
            </div>
            <p>Quizzes will consist of a variety of questions to ensure that you understand the entirety of a topic before moving on to newer, more difficult material. You may only take a quiz after you have completed at least one quest in every previous tier and are of the appropriate level to advance to the next set of quests. When your TA has approved it, you may pick up a quiz and one of the instructors will proctor and grade it promptly.</p>
            <p>You may only take ONE (1) quiz per day. If you do not pass, you will be required to take it again (on another day), but it is the FIRST quiz that you take whose score we will record for your final grade. You will also not receive the full credits amount. So please take your first attempt seriously and don't try to jump on it when you're not ready!</p>
            <div class="h3">
              <p class="noMargin">Exams</p>
            </div>
            <p>Exams will be designed to test the student's absorption of the material. They will consist of a variety of questions, from multiple choice and short answer to actually writing markup that must work and validate. Unlike quests, exams DO have a set time and consist of a set amount of material; we expect that you will pace yourself appropriately so that you will be prepared to take the same test as everyone else.</p>
            <div class="h3">
              <p class="noMargin">Projects</p>
            </div>
            <p>There are a total of three projects that also have set due dates. These projects are designed to allow you to exercise your creative muscles in regards to the material you have learned. Though all projects will have guidelines and requirements, you are fully encouraged to feel free to try things and experiment: web design is very much a form of self-expression and should be played with as such!</p>
            <div class="h3">
              <p class="noMargin">Attendance</p>
            </div>
            <p>Due to ATDP's rigorous 6-week schedule, students who miss more than 2 days of class are not eligible for credit. This is the policy of ATDP as a whole and there are no exceptions to this rule. If you expect to be absent from a class, it is to your advantage that you let us know ahead of time (via e-mail or in person during class), though of course many absences are unforeseeable, and we understand that. All work will be readily available for makeup on the course website, but is the sole responsibility of the student to complete and turn in promptly.</p>
            <div class="h3">
              <p class="noMargin">Plagiarism</p>
            </div>
            <p class="noMargin"><b>Plagiarism is grounds for automatic failure of the course.</b> Cheating, copying from other students, or using content without giving credit are all forms of fraud and punishment for such actions will be at the discretion of your instructors. <i>Be sure to give credit to any information or images that are not your creation. </i> If you find yourself falling behind on assignments or on a project, feel free to come and talk to us about it. It is <i>much</i> better to turn in half an assignment or turn it in late than to be dishonest and copy or plagiarize. </p>
