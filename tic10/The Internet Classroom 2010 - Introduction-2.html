            <p>In this class, students will learn how to understand, navigate and engage the internet with ease; become familiar with the underlying technologies of a computer network; design and code standards-based websites; and acquire a meaningful context within which to place our &quot;information age,&quot; with its diverse array of online communities. Students will create websites using XHTML and CSS, with an eye towards coding according to web standards. They will be introduced to various common technologies that make up today's internet and will be experimenting with off-the-shelf programs such as Adobe Photoshop and Flash. Students will investigate the technical, sociological, and even philosophical issues regarding the impact of the internet and information technology on students and their families, on schools and their communities, and on society at large.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="noMargin">This course is geared towards aspiring web designers who are interested in learning how to effectively deliver ideas online. Students will develop the skills to code and publish standards-based websites, with an emphasis on design and common practices. They will master the building blocks for presenting content on the web and exercise these skills through design exercises with the student's own creative ideas. Students will also be introduced to the theory and practice of developing designs for today's internet, with its multitude of user-driven website communities and content management systems. Applicants should be proficient with computer and internet use and will be required to take a placement test for this class. (Students who have taken a previous Internet Classroom course are welcome to apply for this class, although the material for the first 2 weeks will overlap with previous summers' coursework.)</p>
