            <p>&quot;web service&quot;: In general, any online service delivered from a Web site.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>For this project, you will choose one (1) web service and produce a detailed report that includes three sections: a detailed <b>description</b> of the service, a step-by-step <b>tutorial</b> on the use of the service, and an <b>opinion</b> section.</p>
            <p>Some questions that your <b>description</b> section might answer (but not only these!): What is the purpose of this site? What are its main features? Who uses this website (age group/gender/etc)? Do you have to know much about computers in order to use this site? Are there other sites out there that offer similar services? Does it cost money? </p>
            <p>Your <b>tutorial</b> section should clearly explain to a novice computer user how they use the site (or for complex web services, only some primary features of the site). You should think about how a user navigates around the site, how the features of the site appear visually, and what steps are involved in using the site. You may also wish to point out problems or common mistakes a user might encounter while using the service.</p>
            <p>Some questions that your <b>opinion</b> section might answer (but not only these!): Is this service better than other similar websites (or if it's not, which one is, and for what reasons)? Do you personally use this web service? Is it a helpful tool in your daily life or just a form of entertainment? Or both? Do you think it does its job well or poorly? What would you change about this service?</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Everyone will need to choose the subject of their web service report by Friday, June 25. Your choice must meet with instructor approval, so you should come up with two or three ideas just in case we don't agree with your first. We will happily share recommendations on how to structure your paper depending on the service you will be investigating.</p>
            <hr>
            <div class="h3">
              <p class="noMargin">Rubric</p>
            </div>
            <p>Your report must be a minimum of four-pages, double-spaced (12-pt font maximum). It is due at the beginning of class on <b>Friday, July 2</b>.</p>
            <p>The final grade of your report will be calculated based on your performance in the following areas:</p>
            <p><b>50% - Content/Information:</b> Is the information in the report complete, authentic, and accurate? Are assertions backed up with concrete facts? Is the tutorial thorough and detailed within its scope? Do the presented opinions make logical sense?<br><b>15% - Format:</b> Does the report follow the project requirements? Is it double-spaced, in a readable font, and submitted in an acceptable manner (see below)?<br><b>15% - Organization:</b> Are paragraphs, sentences, and ideas arranged in a way that makes sense? Does each paragraph have a main focus? Was the report built with an intentional structure, or does it seem to meander heedlessly? Is the tutorial section organized in a visually and conceptually clear manner?<br><b>10% - Writing Quality:</b> Does the report use complete sentences? Is it free from spelling mistakes, typos, and grammatical errors?</p>
            <p class="noMargin">You may turn in your report by emailing a Word DOC file or PDF file to Kass or Dev by the beginning of class on the due date. You may alternatively turn in a printed copy. It is very important that you retain an electronic copy of your report.</p>
