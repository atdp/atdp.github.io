            <p>&quot;web technology&quot;: In general, any software or hardware involved in delivering or running online content.</p>
            <p><i>Some examples: HTML, DNS, CSS, Flash, Apache, the wireless router, fiber optics</i></p>
            <hr>
            <p>For this project, you will choose one (1) example of web technology, OR one (1) person who invented such technology, or who otherwise played (or plays) a significant role in the history of the Internet. You will build a website that reports on your topic with a minimum of four (4) sections: <b>Introduction</b>, <b>Quick Facts</b>, <b>History</b>, and <b>References</b>. Each section should be put on separate web pages that link to every other, and you are welcome — nay, encouraged! — to add more if you think the required sections won't cover your topic adequately.</p>
            <p>Your <b>Introduction</b> section provides a thorough overview of your topic. If your topic is technology, describe what it is, how it works, and why it's important. If your topic is a person, describe who they are, what they did, and why it was important. Cite several examples of your answers. Your introduction should be equivalently to roughly one type-written page, double-spaced.</p>
            <p>Your <b>Quick Facts</b> page should present easy-to-skim information about your topic. Use tables and/or lists to present facts you find interesting. Include at least two different categories (for example: a list of awards and achievements, or a table comparing the technology to other similar alternatives). Include at least one image on this page.</p>
            <p>Your <b>History</b> page should present a chronological timeline of your topic, from birth to present day. You may write descriptively, like in your Introduction section, or you may present the information with elements such as tables and lists, like in your Quick Facts page.</p>
            <p>Finally, information throughout the three (or more!) previous sections should link to relevant entries on your <b>References</b> page, which in turn link to the online source you used to research that particular information. You should also include an &quot;Additional Sources&quot; section here, with links to other websites that are specific to your topic.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>You will need instructor approval of your topic before beginning work on this project. We recommend you do this by the end of the day on Friday, June 25, so you have the weekend to get a good start on it. Your project is due (which means it is fully uploaded, functional, and linked to your class index) at the beginning of class on <b>Friday, July 2</b>.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The final grade of your website will be calculated based on your performance in the following areas:</p>
            <p class="noMargin"><b>50% - Content/Information:</b> Is the information on each page complete, authentic, and accurate? Are assertions backed up with concrete facts? Is the history thorough and detailed within its scope? Are your references clearly marked and accurate?<br><b>20% - Correct HTML/CSS:</b> Are all your pages correctly marked up with working hyperlinks? Do they validate and include a validation link/icon? If your pages are styled using CSS, is your style markup properly employed and coded?<br><b>15% - Format/Organization:</b> Does the website follow the project requirements? Are paragraphs, tables, and ideas arranged in a way that makes sense?<br><b>10% - Writing Quality:</b> Does the information on your pages use complete sentences? Is it free from spelling mistakes, typos, and grammatical errors?<br><b>5% - Creativity:</b> Does your project go beyond the requirements in any way? Are there any written, visual, or interactive elements that are engaging, fun, or artistic?</p>
