              <p class="noMargin">TIC  ETIQUETTE</p>
            </div>
            <p>The Internet Classroom is an academic site. <i>Common-sense</i> internet etiquette -- or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netiquette">'netiquette'</a> -- is expected of all participants here. Civil discourse in all postings or comments on these pages is also expected. However, here are some specific instructions, in no particular order:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p class="noMargin"><b>Use inoffensive account names.</b> Account names cannot contain objectionable strings of text. What is 'objectionable'? The usual: words or phrases that are <i>x-rated, lewd, insulting, hateful, etc.</i> We will definitely expunge inappropriate names from the User List, as well as block the IP addresses from which those user accounts have been set up.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="noMargin"><b>Practice civility.</b> Objectionable postings will be similarly dealt with (see above).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="noMargin"><b>Don't spam.</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28electronic%29">Spam</a> postings will be deleted.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="noMargin"><b>Practice reasonable linkage.</b> Postings with links to objectionable sites will be deleted.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="h2">
              <p class="noMargin">SITE SPECIFIC</p>
            </div>
            <p>The software that runs this site is called Io Community Manager (IoCM for short) and has a few capabilities that you've probably never seen on other sites before. The first thing is the <a href="The%20Internet%20Classroom%20-%20Activity%20Tracker.html"><b>Activity Tracker</b></a>. This page shows you all the latest posts, edits, and additions that have happened on the site and is very useful for seeing where all the action is, without having to burrow or browse through the various forums.</p>
            <p class="noMargin">When you're traversing the forums, you may notice that certain posters have unique background colors for their posts. This indicates that they have some specific role in the whole Internet Classroom schema. The color coding works as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p class="noMargin"><b><span style="color: #FFA500;">orange</span></b> - TIC Instructors or TAs</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="noMargin"><b><span style="color: #808080;">gray</span></b> - Students in the AM session</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="noMargin"><b><span style="color: #87CEEB;">blue</span></b> - Students in the PM session</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="noMargin"><b><span style="color: #90EE90;">green</span></b> - Non-TIC staff and Internet Classroom alumni</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>(If you are just posting to the TIC site for the first time, your post may not show up as the color it should be. Don't panic, this is normal. Your post will become colored once an admin gets around to changing it.)</p>
            <p class="noMargin">Finally, IoCM has its own method for styling your posts and comments. Check out the <a href="http://128.32.250.49:8081/tic/intro/forumcode/">Forum Code guide</a> for that if you'd like to add italics or bold to your posts occasionally.</p>
