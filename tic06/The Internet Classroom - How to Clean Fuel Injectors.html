                <p>There are several ways of cleaning fuel injectors. One is to use one of the varieties of fuel injector cleaners on the market and do it yourself or take it to a mechanic and have them do an in-tank cleaning with a fuel injector cleaner kit.</p>
                <p>Another method is to remove the fuel injector and have it professionally serviced as well as cleaned. While this last method may be more expensive and time consuming, it also can be the best fuel injector cleaning process. This process is better because in addition to cleaning there is also fuel injector repair done on the injector at the same time, which is important to do approximately once a year. This article will focus on how to clean fuel injectors yourself (the in-tank method) and why it is best to have it removed once a year and serviced.</p>
                <p>How to clean <a href="http://www.autopartswarehouse.com/fuel_injectors~pop.html">fuel injectors</a>:</p>
                <p>The fuel injector is a small engine part that injects fuel where it needs to go at a rate that is best suited for the car. When in perfect condition, the fuel injector both filters out debris that is not good for the engine; it then allows the filtered fuel to be used by the engine correctly. Cars run properly and get the best mileage when the fuel injection system works properly and is cleaned. The fuel injector cleaning process works best if you can find the best fuel injector cleaner for your particular car.</p>
                <p>To begin your fuel injector cleaning you will need a fuel injector cleaning kit. After you have selected a kit, you are then ready to begin the fuel injector cleaning process. First you will need to locate and make sure that the fuel will not go through the injector while the car is started, using tubing to bypass the fuel injector or removing the fuel pump and preventing fuel to enter the injectors.</p>
                <p>At this point cleaning the fuel injectors requires only that you hook up the fuel injector cleaners to the fuel injectors you wish to clean, start the engine and wait until the solvent to goes through the injectors completely. At this point you are only finished when you attempt to start to engine without the cleaners hooked up to the engine and you notice a significant change. If not, retry the whole procedure. If you still do not notice, a difference you will need go to a fuel injector cleaning service at your local mechanic shop.</p>
                <p>Yearly service is necessary<br>It is very important to have your fuel injectors serviced annually. This is necessary for several reasons. It is necessary because when you do an in-tank method of cleaning your injector you are not able to see the condition of the filters, O-rings and other parts of the injector. These do eventually wear out and can cause low mileage and other problems.</p>
                <p>It is good to get the injectors replaced at least once a year to ensure a healthy engine and good gas mileage. It is also important because the in-tank method can actually damage parts of the injectors, such as the filter, seals, oxygen sensors and other parts of the injector. With a professional off-the car, method of servicing the injectors the mechanic tests them, checks the filters, O-rings and other parts and replaces them if necessary.</p>
                <p>In addition, the mechanic uses a special method of cleaning the injectors that does not cause damage to any of the parts of the injector. Thus, this is the best way to get the injectors serviced and again, it is recommended to get this service at least once a year.</p>
                <p class="noMargin">The fuel injector cleaning process is not a difficult one. All it requires is a good fuel injector cleaner kit, it is also important to know which of the many fuel injector cleaners is best suited for your type of car and fuel injector. Be sure to take your car to a mechanic if when you have finished cleaning the fuel injectors and you do not notice a difference in the way the engine runs. Fuel injector cleaning by yourself at home is good occasionally, but it is important to have the fuel injection system cleaned, repaired and tested by a professional once a year. Knowing how to clean fuel injectors is one important form of car maintenance that can save you money and time in the long run.</p>
