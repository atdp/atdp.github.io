                <p>First off, let's start by stating the obvious: Without the Internet, TIC wouldn't exist and the chances of us all knowing each other would be basically zero.</p>
                <p>Now that that's out of the way... life without the Internet for me is like life without the Sun. Well, maybe not so extreme, but pretty close. Since the majority of us probably depend on the Internet to fuel our social networks...</p>
                <p>Though then the topic changes to &quot;what is a world without friends,&quot; the two could very well be interchangeable, for me especially. It may not seem that big of a deal with certain sites going crazy with shallow online friendships, but there are instances when the Internet can provide deep and long-lasting bonds between people who know nothing about each other. Thanks to the anonymity (even if the other person knows your identity) that the Internet implies, it becomes easier for Introverts to approach people. Without that....</p>
                <p>I can't see how life would be better without it, other than that my vision might  still be perfect if the Internet didn't exist. Then again, I don't see how life would be worse either. If you take into account that the world we live in today, the technologically advanced first-world countries, has been designed and molded around the Internet, it would make sense then that in a different world where the Internet had not been created, that  the world would have developed in a completely different direction that did not depend on an Internet? For example, today most of us rely on the Internet for information to do our homework. However, this is because teachers take the Internet  into consideration when assigning homework. If the Internet did not exist, then teachers wouldn't give the homework that required the Internet to answer. So any functions that we may use the Internet for may even be unnecessary in that world where the Internet doesn't exist. But this is all speculative of course.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I believe that the Internet was probably an inevitable development. The growing population spread farther and farther across the world begged for growth in communications and after the telephone and television, it was only a matter of time before someone attempted to combine them both (or what not). Word of mouth can only go so far...</p>
                <p>Moving on, I'd say 99% of all my friends use the Internet on a daily basis if at all possible. And that I do know some people who don't use the Internet, but they aren't my friends exactly.</p>

                <p>If the internet never existed I would never be the person I am today. :P There have been countless online influences that have shaped my personality. The internet is my friend (until the moment it stops functioning as it should). Without the help on online tutorials, the ablity to observe other artists, and to get my art online, I wouldn't be photoshop crazy like I am now. Without AIM, I probably wouldn't have people to go to for advice or even comfort when I needed it. The internet has also provided a place to grow and learn social etiquite (spelling...). So, taking away the internet would be like loosing a family memeber or a close friend. Especially a friend or family memeber taken for granted.</p>
                <p>I have gone long periods of time without the internet before so I have to say that it's not that bad.... I must admit that I studied much more then and focused much better, too. Maybe my grades would be better if the internet didn't exist. Also, maybe I'd visit the dispised library more often, too. The alternative for the internet, in my world, is Photoshop. Max asked me on Friday &quot;how would you life be without the internet?&quot; and I asked &quot;do I have photoshop?&quot; He had to think about it but he said yes and I replied &quot;Then I'm fine.&quot; :D I probably spend just as much time in photoshop as I do browsing the web.</p>
                <p class="noMargin">Nearly all my friends use the internet and take it for granted. The few that don't are the ones that are too busy doing their homework all day. :P And.. no sports for me. Sports are fun to play, not watch.</p>

                <p>Every question is intertwined with the others. Answering one at a time will most likely not allow you to grasp the whole picture. Answer in your own style, however be sure that you're not just taking questions piecemeal. As long as you get the main idea, you're fine.</p>
