                <p>One day a fluffy squishy cloud was floating down a manhole to eat cherry pie. But the cherry got picked by a monkey hermit who was a big pie actually. byte of data which was never ever ever ever a monkey that ate humans. </p>
                <p>The big pickle regurgitated an enormous chunk of giant hairball all of its which was a useless piece of cherry pie. It really like her big poofy wig so she ate some peach crumble with whipped cream but it resulted in a bomb that went KABLOOSH! The wrecked city shrieked in terror and teleported to the far reaches of the planet which contained random decorated Nok figures that appeared to be attacking the descendants of the voodoo natives. </p>
                <p>They got bored and went to stare at the lovers who were making out in the courtyard with the singers who were having a horrible time trying to digest the food which was pie. Suddenly, a light cream cake fell on the head of the lovers who weren't amused but really were some aliens from the planet mars. The lovers turned a vivid aubergine into a pie. This pie was... eaten by Norman who is a fat pie eater that hails from monkey land. Monkeys invaded Saturn and threw pies at Norman Zhu, who eats  carrots.</p>
                <p>He decided to play ultimate extreme twister and fell on his head and ate more pie because he had nothing better to do. Then the cherry pies came falling on the heads of the aubergined lovers. Chagrined, they turned to aliens from Monkeyland and dropped snowballs in Monkeyland. Snowballs being of unequaled did not melt. Then a pie grew wings and pulled a muscle and fell into a steaming pile of saliva in front of a plate on Norman's nose. </p>
                <p>He was hungry and ate uncontrollably until he ate more pieee. Then she went and retrieved superfluous pus from Norman's mouth. He ate too much toxic bagels, which gave a lot of indigestion to Norman. Then she went and found a very very very tasty blueberry pie. Then the pie turned into a tastier pie which Norman ate voraciously. AND THEN DIED and went to weird people Heaven. Then Visha died and also went somewhere far away where she found Norman's mangled body which was malfunctioning.</p>
