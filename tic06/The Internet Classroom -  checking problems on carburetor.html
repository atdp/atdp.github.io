                <p>A <a href="http://www.autopartswarehouse.com/carburetor~pop.html">carburetor</a> is responsible for combining both air and fuel and sending this air/fuel mixture into a car's engine to be burned, a process that creates engine power. A faulty or malfunctioning carburetor can lead to a variety of engine problems, most of which are related directly to problems with air and fuel delivery into an engine.</p>
                <p>      Black Exhaust Smoke<br>   1. A car that emits black, or dark, exhaust smoke from its tail pipe is normally a car experiencing a carburetion problem. A carburetor is responsible for balancing out a car's air/fuel mixture, a mixture that flows into a car's engine and gets ignited. If a carburetor allows too much fuel and not enough air into a car's engine, black, sooty exhaust smoke is normally the result.<br>      Hard Starting Condition<br>   2. A car that cranks but fails to start is often times a sign of a carburetor problem. If a carburetor choke, which helps to start a cold engine, gets stuck open or fails to adequately open during initial starting, a car will not start or be very hard to start. A stuck carburetor choke is a common problem preventing a car from being started.<br>      Stuck Engine Idle<br>   3. Normally, a car's engine idle varies depending on the operating temperature of the engine. When the engine is cold, the idle is higher to facilitate engine warm-up; when warm, the idle drops. A car that has an idle that gets stuck at one speed (normally on high idle) and fails to change is usually a sign of a carburetion problem, generally a problem with the carburetor idle solenoid.<br>      Rough Engine Idle<br>   4. A malfunctioning carburetor can negatively impact a car's engine idle. By interfering with engine air/ fuel mixture, engine idle speed, and fuel flow, a carburetor problem can cause a car's engine idle to become choppy and irregular and, in many instances, cause a car to shut off.<br>      Engine Missing<br>   5. An engine miss, or misfire, can often times because by a faulty or malfunctioning carburetor. An engine miss is usually caused by faulty or irregular engine combustion. If a carburetor impedes or restricts air and/or fuel flow into an engine's cylinders, the resulting engine combustion will be compromised, a situation that can cause an engine miss.</p>
