              <p class="noMargin">Work on your individual website will begin in the 5th week of the session and they will be due for presentation on Tuesday, July 25th. This is your chance to show off everything you have learned and have the ability to do when it comes to web design- treat it as your final. The actual requirements are really quite basic, as we expect you'll find plenty of work to do for it on your own, but if you are puzzled as to what else to add to your site or even how to begin, your instructors and TAs will be here to find things for you and push you along the way. :) </p>

                <p class="noMargin">Must do all work on your own from scratch (no WYSIWYG, templates, etc) except for advanced items such as Javascript codes which may be lifted and then tailored to fit your site.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="noMargin">Must be uploaded to the server by Tuesday, July 25th (to be presented on the 26th).</p>

                <p class="noMargin">Sites must be filled with real content (no 'blah blah blah' / 'content goes here' says Kass hahah)</p>

              <p class="noMargin">The presentation aspect of the assignment is pretty much the same as what we've been doing in class already: introduce your site's purpose, then go through every page and show us how you did everything. After you think you've finished we'll ask you questions in case we feel you've left things out.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="indent">
              <p> You have now learned enough HTML and CSS to make a basic website, and it is about time to put these skills to good use. Your TA is to now become your imaginary client, and you and your groupmates are a team of webdesigners! You are to design a website to the specifications of your 'client' from scratch. The only real requirements are that you satisfy your TA (half of your grade for this assignment will be from your TA, half from Kass and I), do everything from scratch with coding (no WYSIWYG), that all your pages are CSS/XHTML-compliant (validate) and that all your group members have an equal share in the effort.  </p>
              <p>This assignment will be due Friday, July 14th when you and your classmates will present your website to the rest of the class. Along with your presentation, you are to turn in (physically, e-mail, or however you choose) a paper in which you detail the website's creation process. This paper should include each student's responsibilities in the website (who did what), what problems arose during the process and how they were surmounted, and what each of you learned/took away from this project. Also, your group may write a paragraph pleading your case for what grade YOU all believe you should receive. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="indent">
              <p class="noMargin">Your first real project of the session is a simple website presentation. The good news? You don't have to make the website! Each student will pick a popular website that provides some sort of service and present it to the rest of the class on the projector screen. Basically, you are to showcase the features of a website such as MySpace, Gmail, or Xanga and explain why people use it. <br><br>You may choose to work by yourself or as a pair, but each student needs to participate evenly during the presentation. The presentation should be at least 5 minutes long, but should not be in excess of 8 minutes.</p>

              <p class="noMargin">Questions your Presentation Should Answer</p>
            </div>
            <div class="indent">
              <p class="noMargin">What is the purpose of this site? What are its main features? Who uses this website? Do you have to know much about computers in order to use this site? Are there other sites out there that offer similar services? Why is this one better (or if it's not, which one is, and for what reasons)? Do you personally use this web service? Is it a helpful tool in your daily life or just a form of entertainment? Or both? Does it cost money? etc.</p>
